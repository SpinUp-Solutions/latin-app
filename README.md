It's designed to scale to multiple development environments with the scaffolding to handle many use cases. To get up and running:

### 1. Node

Make sure you have [NodeJS version 22](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed. Follow the instructions at that link to install if you haven't already.

### 2. Fork

Fork this repo into the GitHub of your choice.

### 3. Clone

Clone the forked repo to your local environment. Check your new repository's link. If I wanted to clone this repo, the command would be:

`git clone https://github.com/chrisozgo99/nextjs-template.git`

### 4. Install packages:

`npm i`

### 5. Env files

Create `.env`, `.env.development`, `.env.staging`, and `.env.production` files in the project's root. You only need to configure `.env` now, but for projects that plan on having multiple environments, it will be beneficial to have all these files available.

### 6. Create a Firebase project

a. Go to your [Firebase Dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

b. Click **Create Project**

c. Click through all the steps with your desired configuration

d. Once you arrive at the Firebase dashboard, click the **gear icon** and **Project Settings**

e. Scroll down and click **Add app**. Choose a **Web app** with the logo that looks like this: **</>**

f. Give your app a name and click **Register app**

g. Copy the firebaseConfig variable in the next step and enter it into your .env file in the following format:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
```

Below that, in the env file, add the following as well:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-website-url.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here
```

Your configuration is complete!

### 7. Compile the app

Run the following to compile:

`npm run build`

Then

`npm run dev`

### 8. Environment-specific builds

This project supports development, staging, and production environments. Use the following commands:

#### Development environment (default)

```
npm run dev            # Run the development server with dev environment
npm run build          # Build for dev environment
npm run start          # Start the server with dev environment
```

#### Staging environment

```
npm run dev:staging    # Run the development server with staging environment
npm run build:staging  # Build for staging environment
npm run start:staging  # Start the server with staging environment
```

#### Production environment

```
npm run dev:prod       # Run the development server with production environment
npm run build:prod     # Build for production environment
npm run start:prod     # Start the server with production environment
```

#### Build all environments at once

```
npm run build:all      # Build for development, staging, and production environments
```

### 9. Let's go!

Your app should be visible at `http://localhost:3000`. Time to start building!
